# Machine learning Michaelmas submission

**Rain_Prediction_Dublin.ipynb** is written to analysis and build the most appropriate models for the chosen dataset using feature selection based on box plots and p-values.

The dataset is being fetched from https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublin-airport-daily-data.
This dataset has information for each day from 1941-11-01 till present, but the dataset is updated over internet monthly.

A simulation for the same has been built separately for which the execution steps have been provided below :
(NOTE : Preferrable to have virtual environvment setup)

Clone the Github repository.
```
https://github.com/siddhesh21/Dublin-Rainfall-Analysis-Predictions.git
cd final_assignment/
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

For building the models, use command as below :
```
pip main_exec.py --newdata [yes or no] --model [model choices]
```
If you want to download and import latest available dataset, parse **yes**. (Default **no**)
Model choices:
* **all** will train and save all the available models.
* **logistic** will train and save logistic regression model.
* **SVM** will train and save SVM model.
* **kNN** will train and save kNN model.
* **ridge** will train and save ridge model.
* **neural** will train and save neural network model. 

As simulation, for trying out the models for a date present in the model, use command as below:
(NOTE : Do check the latest date in dly532.csv)
```
pip predictor.py --load [model choices]
```
Model choices:
* **logistic** will train and save logistic regression model.
* **SVM** will train and save SVM model.
* **kNN** will train and save kNN model.
* **ridge** will train and save ridge model.
* **neural** will train and save neural network model. 

Enter the date in the input in format (YYYY-MM-DD).
The prediction for that paricular day will be displayed.
